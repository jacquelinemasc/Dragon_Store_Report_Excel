üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Technical Stack
Data Preparation: Excel (Formulas, Conditional Formatting) was used for data cleaning, handling duplicates/blanks, and initial creation of new feature columns.

Feature Engineering: IF Formula were utilized to create the AgeGroup column (e.g., child, Adult, Senior) and the Month column (extracted from the date field) for better data segmentation.

Data Analysis: Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts were employed extensively for aggregation, summarization, and generating multi-dimensional sales metrics (e.g., Sales vs. AgeGroup vs. Gender).

Visualization: An Interactive Excel Dashboard was created, integrating slicers and charts for professional, real-time data filtering and presentation.

Advanced Analysis: Time Series Analysis (as mentioned in the project objective) was applied using forecasting models to generate a 15-day sales prediction.
